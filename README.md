"Oh nein! Dieser b√∂se Lehrer schickte dich in Gewahrsam!"
             - Back of the box
AT THE CURRENT MOMENT, THIS DEMO IS SOMEWHAT GLITCHY, UNTIL ANOTHER VERSION IS FOUND, WE ARE STUCK WITH THIS ONE.
A text game made by 2 German studios named Valve Spiele and Unbenanntes Professionelles Spielstudio from 1986. For some odd reason though, the front and back of the box is in German, while the actual game is in English. The game is actually lost, as there is currently no actual way to play the game currently. This is actually a demo for episode 1 of the game that was bundled with select games in 1989. Also, in 1997, a remaster was planned for the PC, and Playstation, but got scrapped due to the game being very obscure. The game has 3 epsiodes, but at the current moment, as previously stated, only the demo for episode 1 has been found so far.
